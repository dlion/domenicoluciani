One of the worst things that can be happens to a twitter user is surely to be unfollows but how to discover who unfollow you ? To solve this problem I create an ad-hoc offline and commandline tools to do that.

## How does it work ?

It is wrote entirely in Go, it works using the Twitter's API to obtain all followers of a particular account and then compare them with the local database, if a follower is missing the tool report it to you, also it reports to you if you have a new followers.

## Go-odbye

I named it **Go-odbye**, you can find it [here](https://github.com/dlion/go-odbye), just clone it on your computer and compile it using the golang compiler.

## Usage

To use Go-odbye first of all you need  the right creds to use the Twitter's API, to do that you have to create a new application on it, visit this link: [https://apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com), after that you will obtain 4 keys: _Consumer key_, _Consumer secret key_, _Access token key_ and _Access secret key_. After you have been clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/dlion/go-odbye ; cd go-odbye` create a json configuration file on your $HOME directory named `.goodbye.json` using this structure:

```js
{
  "consumerKey": "<CONSUMER KEY>",
  "consumerSecret": "<CONSUMER SECRET>",
  "accessToken": "<ACCESS TOKEN>",
  "accessSecret": "<ACCESS SECRET>"
}
```
and put in it your keys and save it, to run the tool you need to resolve some dependencies like go-twitter, oauth1, color and go-sqlite3, so type `go get` on your shell and after that you can run and use it. For example, to see all my [un]followers I have to type `go run main.go -nick dlion92`, here a possible output:

Obviously everything can be improved, in the future I could add to do analysis on followers or something else, who knows. If you have suggestions or just want to contribute you are welcome!
