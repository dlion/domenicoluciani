I decided to expose myself more and more, I like to share my opinions and experiences (you can say reading this blog), and this time I decided to attend as a interviewee for a well known Podcast in Italy talking about something I've done for 3 months, are you curious about it?


A few weeks ago, I've been interviewed by [PointerPodcast](https://pointerpodcast.it/) about my experience during my [Take 3](https://domenicoluciani.com/2023/11/16/buildpacks-3-months-later.html) and how I work in Tanzu Labs.

It was quite fan, even tho in some points I feel there will be more and more to talk about, I just barely scratched the surface.   
Yeah sorry for any english speaker, it's in Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

You can find the episode on Spotify and Apple Podcast here:
