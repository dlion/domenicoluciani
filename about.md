title: About me
---

Passionate [programmer](/category/programming), more than 10 years of experience including 4 years as extreme programmer and a bachelor degree in Computer Science. I currently work as Senior Agile Software Engineer at [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), living in MÃ¡laga, Spain but working remotely (and **I LOVE** it)

I'm [Computer Vision](/category/opencv) enthusiast, I love [security](/category/security), and writing silly [pieces of code](https://github.com/DLion). I usually like to improve my knowledge about TDD, Clean Code and Extreme Programming.

I'm a [Raspberry Pi](/category/raspberrypi) owner.
