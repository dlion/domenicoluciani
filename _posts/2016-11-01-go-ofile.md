The first phase in security assessment is focused on collecting as much information as possible about a target application. One tool to do that is [Goofile](http://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/goofile), it allows to search a specify filetype in a specify domain using Google...

I read that the development of this python script was stopped in the 2012 so yesterday I wrote my own Golang version called [Go-ofile](https://github.com/dlion/go-ofile) just for fun, it is a Golang clone of goofile which allows to have a binary file to take anywhere without deps.

## Usage

The usage is very simple, you have only 2 flags:

* -d `domain name`
* -f `filetype`

## Example

`./go-ofile -d unipa.it -f pdf`

Obviously for suggestions, bugs, etc. you can open an [issue](https://github.com/dlion/go-ofile/issues); PR are welcome too!
