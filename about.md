Passionate [programmer](/category/programming), 28 years old at the moment, I have more than 9 yars of experience and I currently work as Agile Software Engineer at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) living in Barcelona, Spain.

I'm [Computer Vision](/category/opencv) enthusiast, I love [security](/category/security), and writing silly [pieces of code](https://github.com/DLion). I usually like to improve my knowledge about TDD, Clean Code and Extreme Programming.

I am (or at least I try to be) a maker, I'm a [Raspberry Pi](/category/raspberrypi) owner.
