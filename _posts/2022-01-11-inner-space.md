This year one of my annual resolutions was to be more present online.   
I want to be more visible and share more content.   
I want to create more articles and share them with more people.   
Learn from feedback and grow the number of people with whom I interact.

So, today I decided to create my newsletter called: InnerSpace ðŸš€

## RSS? Can you eat it?

I don't know how many people still use feed RSS nowadays.   
I've been using them for a while, but I don't see many people speaking about them anymore, so I decided to find another way to share my blog posts regularly without the need to share them everywhere.   
I have a RSS feed just [right here](https://domenicoluciani.com/feed.xml) maybe someone who is still using them could find it useful.


## Revue

I discovered [https://www.getrevue.co/](https://www.getrevue.co/), a simple tool that helped me to create my newsletter, customise it and even have a fixed subdomain where to find all the issues, for free.
The experience was quite smoothly so far, let's see how it goes.

## Topics

I will share my blog posts about:

* extreme programming
* system design
* security
* IoT
* thoughts, useful links and articles

## Insights

Revue also gives some insights about my articles, receiving passive feedback.   
Here I don't have analytics and I think that I'm missing a lot of feedback from them.   
I think would be nice verifying which content you like most.   
For you to obtain more tuned content and for me to understand you better.

## Subscription

It's free, you just need to subscribe, and once in a while, you will receive my issues.   
I don't have a specific plan for them, I don't want to put to myself any kind of constraint and I don't want to set any kind of expectation.

You can find the newsletter here: [Inner Space ðŸš€](https://innerspace.domenicoluciani.com)
