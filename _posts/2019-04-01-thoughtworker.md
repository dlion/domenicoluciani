Finally I found time to write this post, I want to say it to the world: I moved abroad.

After a long period in Milan, I decided finally to move abroad. I decided finally to change my life and to escape from my comfort-zone.

From today I will live in Barcelona, Spain. What is the name of the company I will work for?

### Thoughtworks

TW doesn't need any kind of presentation, who works in this field already know how cool is this company.

So: new life, new city, new job, new friends, new new new.

Wish me luck!
