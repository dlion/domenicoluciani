Today I've talked with [ItalianCoders](https://italiancoders.it/) about my experience abroad as a Software Developer.
With me other five developers who are working around the world, talking about their experiences and why/how they decided to move abroad.

It was a very nice experience, we had a nice exchange of opinions regardin many topics like remote working, salary, difficulties encountered and much more.

The discussion was in Italian only, sorry for that but I'm pretty sure Youtube can provide a very good translation.

You can find the video here, enjoy!
