Two years ago I completely changed my life joining [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/).

I moved abroad (Spain) and I grew so much in so many levels that it's difficult to explain it.

I started to speak everyday in another language. (ENG)

I've met lots of talented professionals

I've made new friends. (who ARE also talented professionals)

I've learned another language (ESP)

I improved what I've already known

It's been an amazing journey so far and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to live it.

After more than 2 years in Thoughtworks, I'm thrilled to announce that I joined [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) as Senior Software Engineer.

I'm gonna be part of the [Tanzu Labs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/en/labs) team which works using Extreme Programming methodologies, this time I'm gonna be full-remote for the first time.

I'm gonna keep posting about my journey and hopefully be able to create quality content from this experience so wish me luck on [@Twitter](https://twitter.com/DLion92) âœ¨
