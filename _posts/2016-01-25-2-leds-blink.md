I have a raspberry pi, I love eletronics so which best example of make 2LEDs blinks using a small pushbutton ?

## Requirements
- 1 breadboard
- 1 10kOhm resistor
- 2 3kOhm resistors
- many jumpers
- 1 push button
- 2 LED
- 1 raspberry pi
- 1 plutonium bar (I'm joking :mortar_board:)

## Software
I wrote a simple C programs to do everything

{% highlight c linenos=table %}
/*
 * How to make 2 leds blinks pushing a button
 * By Domenico Luciani aka DLion
 */

//Using wiringPi library
#include <wiringPi.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main (void)
{
	//Using pin 8 to read input (pin 3 on the raspi)
	int pin8_in = 8;
	//Using pin 0 and 1 to write output (pin 11 and 12 on the raspi)
	int pin0_out = 0;
	int pin1_out = 1;
	//Starting Setup
	if(wiringPiSetup() == -1)
		exit(1);
	//Set pin 8 to input
	pinMode(pin8_in,INPUT);
	//Set pin 0 and 1 to output
	pinMode(pin0_out,OUTPUT);
	pinMode(pin1_out,OUTPUT);

	while(1)
	{
		//Push button pressed
		if(digitalRead(pin8_in) == 0)
		{
			//LED 0 ON
			digitalWrite(pin0_out,1);
			//Wait 50 ms
			delay(50);
			//LED 1 ON
			digitalWrite(pin1_out,1);
			delay(50);
			//LED 0 OFF
			digitalWrite(pin0_out,0);
			delay(50);
			//LED 1 OFF
			digitalWrite(pin1_out,0);
			delay(50);
		}
		//Wait 100 ms
		delay(100);
	}
	return 0;
}

How can you see I used the famous [wiringPi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/) library that allows to use the GPIO ports of the raspi like an arduino.

Here an image to understand how pin works and how to identify it using wiringPi library

![pinsheet](/assets/images/posts/pin_datasheet.jpg)


In this article we are working on the
* 1 (3.3v) - current on
* 3 (SDA0) - to read when we push the button
* 6 (0V) - ground
* 11 (GPIO 0) - to make LED1 blinks
* 12 (GPIO 1) - to make LED2 blinks
pins.

### Warning: make attention to use the 1 pin, on the left. On the right there is a 2 pin and it puts out 5v and can breaks your board.

Now connect your pushbutton : V3.3 -> 10kOhm -> 3 Pin -> PushButton -> 0v
Now connect your leds: 11 pin -> 330 Ohm -> +LED1 -> -LED1 -> 0V and 12 pin -> 330 Ohm -> +LED2 -> -LED2 -> 0V

A simple image:

and now to compile and execute the source:

`gcc source.c -o blink -lwiringPi ; sudo ./blink`
