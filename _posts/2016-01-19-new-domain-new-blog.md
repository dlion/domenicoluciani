Ok, I bought a new domain name; my domain name, so I think it's right to make a new blog. From now I will post using only the english language to improve my knowledge about it and to share my thoughts to everyone.

If you find mistakes, typo, etc. don't hesitate to contact me, I love correcting my mistakes! :smile:   
So that's all! Maybe in the future I will rewrite my [old posts](http://dlion.it) so everybody can read my shitty old posts about useless stuff, enjoy!
